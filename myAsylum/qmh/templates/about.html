<h2>About</h2>

<p>The Quakers & Mental Health portal launched in the summer of 2015 as an iterative website to hold scholarship about the history of mental health in Philadelphia, in the 19th and 20 centuries, and in particular of Friends Hospital, the first private mental health institution in the United States. This multi-year project combines archival research and writing with digital scholarship to create and support scholarship on the history of mental health, to analyze data and create visualizations from that research. The Friends Hospital records, which are on loan to Haverford College Quaker & Special Collections, offer a wealth of information on Quakerism, the treatment of the mentally ill, and the development of American psychiatric hospitals in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
    <p>The Friends Asylum for the Relief of Persons Deprived of the Use of their Reason was founded in 1813 by a group of Philadelphia Quakers who were concerned about the state of mentally ill Quakers. The Asylum was established upon the Quaker idea that there is<!-- <a class="glossary" title="That of God in Everyone: A phrase used to describe the Inner Light, the idea that each person has something of God in them, which they can listen to for guidance.">--> that of God</a> in every person, and that mental illness does not change that fact. Under the leadership of Isaac Bonsall as the first superintendent, and a group of other influential, soon-to-be <!--<a class="glossary" title="Orthodox Quakers: Formed during the Hicksite-Orthodox schism in 1827; Orthodox Quakers moved more towards standard Protestantism; they were on top of the Quaker power structure, and they were uneasy with what they saw as the Hicksite Friends' dismissal of the Bible as a source of authority.">--> Orthodox Quakers</a>, the Asylum started accepting patients in 1817. The touchstones of life at the Asylum were community and religious life, and these were to become part of its unique take on moral treatment.</p>

  <h3>Anonymity in Friends Hospital Records</h3>
    <p>Over the course of the past six years of this project, we have talked many times about how much personal data we should be sharing and, for instance, whether or not we should anonymize the data.</p>
<p>On the whole, we have decided that materials up until the 1920s should not be anonymized, and that we will evaluate any projects we do with data post-1920. This will be a rolling 100-year anonymization.</p>
<p>There are two ways to work through this conclusion: legally and morally.</p>
<p>What is the legal obligation of the Haverford College Quaker &amp; Special Collections to anonymize or restrict Friends Hospital records? In the United States, HIPAA is the health privacy rules followed by covered entities and business associates.1 There is also a difference between different kinds of information. As the records in the collection are progress notes, having these non-anonymized is acceptable.2 Progress notes are created by a provider with the intention of being able to be shared with their client, and insurance providers.3 The information created is separate from any direct medical record.  According to both these standards, the Quaker &amp; Special Collections is not obligated to restrict any Friends Hospital records or abide by HIPAA.</p>
<p>The moral obligation to anonymize or not is, of course, more complex. There are two key aspects when considering what to anonymize: respecting patient privacy and helping destigmatize mental health. Records at Friends Hospital detail highly personal information, often covering some of the most difficult periods of patients’ lives. As the vast majority of patients researched as part of the Scattergood internships are deceased, they cannot consent to having their information publicly shared. Given this, we regard choosing to share patient information very seriously. However, we also feel that it is important that we do as much as possible to destigmatize mental illness. Mental illness, both historically and currently, has often been accompanied by severe stigma: those with mental health problems can face social ostracization, which makes it difficult to live, work, and build relationships.4 However, this stigma can be addressed and mitigated when people have contact with those living with mental illness. This is most effective when the contact is direct, but disclosure and contact of any kind can help decrease stigma.5 Thus, publishing the full names of patients at Friends Hospital contributes to the creation of a culture in which mental illness can be discussed more openly.</p>
<p>To attempt to balance both patient privacy and destigmatization, we decided against anonymizing pre-1920 data, and will determine whether to anonymize more recent data on a case-by-case basis, as mentioned above. We do not make these decisions lightly, and will continue to carefully consider questions of privacy, stigma, and anonymity.</p>

<h5>Summer 2021</h5>
    <p><b>Kate Scully '22, Seattle, WA</b></p>
    <p><b>Major/Minor:</b> History/Education and Health Studies</p>
    <p>This summer, I focused on how race influenced patient acceptance/treatment and hiring practices at Friends Hospital from 1870-1948, with a particular focus on the exclusion of Black patients. I also wrote shorter essays on commitments processes at the Asylum, how nymphomaniacs were diagnosed and treated, and on unusual causes of death in the Asylum in the late 1800s. In addition to my papers, I collaborated to create data visualizations illustrating and analyzing different causes of death.</p>

    <p><b>Anita Zhu ‘22, Bryn Mawr, PA</b></p>
    <p><b>Major/Minor:</b> Psychology/Health Studies</p>
    <p>This summer, I did research on Friends Asylum’s policies and practices regarding race in the pre-Civil War era. Because of the lack of records on patients of color and Asylum policies, I focused on how the origins of the Asylum and its pre-Civil War practices connect to ideas of race and the institution of slavery. For my smaller essays, I wrote about the discrepancies in the archival sources, the use of physical restraints, and a patient Hannah Jones.</p>

<h5>Summer 2019</h5>
    <p><b>Colin Battis '21, Chapel Hill, NC</b></p>
    <p><b>Major/Minor:</b> Environmental Studies/Creative Writing</p>
    <p>I worked this summer to research and write an essay on how patient care at the Asylum changed and was influenced by new developments in medicine during the late decades of the 19th century, a period that hadn’t previously been the subject of much focus. I also worked to write several new pieces for the website that would expand on this research and fit in with the website redesign, and together with Yuying worked on a visualization of how management of the Asylum changed over time.</p>

    <p><b>Yuying Rong '20, Chongqing, China</b></p>
    <p><b>Major/Minor:</b> Biology/Theater</p>
    <p>With guidance from the team, I renovated the Quakers &amp; Mental Health website from back end to front end: tidying up directories and files, rewriting scripts, unifying templates and layouts, fixing bugs, making the webpages responsive to different screen sizes, and rebuliding Bokeh-served data visualization with Plotly.js. Colin and I also created new contents. The website is now easier to navigate and more accessible to a wider range of audience.</p>

<h5>Summer 2017</h5>
    <p><b>Alison Rosenman '20, Mercer Island, WA</b></p>
    <p><b>Major/Minor:</b> Computer Science/Economics</p>
    <p>I worked with Claire this summer to understand the Asylum's patients in closer detail. I created the visualizations throughout the website which focus on religious diversity and how gender affected patients' treatments and experiences, as well as the map of patient hometowns. I hope that these visualizations bring the data from Haverford's Friends Asylum collection to life and that future scholarship can come out of our work for the summer.</p>

    <p><b>Claire Michel '18, New York, NY</b></p>
    <p><b>Major/Minor:</b> Pyschology/Economics</p>
    <p>I have been working, along with Alison, to research and describe what it was like for individuals of different religions, genders, and races within the asylum. I conducted research in Haverford’s Special Collection on the different experiences of unique individuals in order to paint a more complete picture of life in the asylum. The research I have been doing has become part of a essay on what it was like to live in the asylum with different identities.</p>

<h5>Summer 2016</h5>

    <p><b>James Truitt '17, Washington, DC</b></p>
    <p><b>Major/Minor:</b> History/Linguistics</p>
    <p>Along with Maddie, I did research and wrote labels for <em> Deprived of the Use of their Reason.</em> In addition to curating the exhibit, I wrote a short piece on patient employment and amusement.  I hope that our exhibition will encourage others to explore the rich history of Friends' Asylum.</p>

    <p><b>Madison Arnold-Scerbo '18, Red Lion, PA</b></p>
    <p><b>Major/Minor:</b> History/Museum Studies</p>
    <p>I worked alongside James to curate and write labels for the physical exhibit <em>Deprived of the Use of their Reason</em> that will be on display in the Sharpless Gallery of Haverford's Magill Library. We spent most of the summer reading through materials in the collection and writing labels for them. I also created data visualizations about the type and causes of mental illness at Friends' Asylum which can be found throughout this website.</p>

<h5>Summer 2015</h5>

    <p><b>Abby Corcoran '17, Greensboro, NC</b></p>
    <p><b>Major/Minor:</b> History/English</p>
    <p>Along with Lindsay, I spent the summer researching the early history of the Friends' Asylum. I looked at how the founders' Quakerism influenced their ideas about the curability mental illness, and wrote an essay using this research. The research that Lindsay and I have been doing will create a framework for future projects about Quakers and mental health, which will be housed on the website that Lindsay has created.</p>

    <p><b>Lindsay Silver '15, Hingham, MA</b></p>
    <p><b>Major/Minors:</b> English/Computer Science, Spanish</p>
    <p>Working in conjunction with Abby, I am creating a website which focuses on the framing research she has been doing all summer. For the website, I am also looking at ways we can extract data from the collection which can then be included in interesting and interactive visualizations online. I also hope to create the website in such a way as to lay the groundwork for future digital projects related to Quakers and mental health.</p>
