<h4>1850-1888: Medical Management</h4>
<p>
In 1850, the superintendent of the asylum took over the duties of the head physician. With moral treatment now considered a medical practice, it was considered important for the superintendent to understand and manage all aspects of patient treatment rather than splitting authority between the superintendent and the medical department.
